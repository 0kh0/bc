Please take a piece of paper and write down
the digits '0', '1', or '2' thirty times at random.
Arrange them in three lines of ten digits each.
I will ask for then ten at a time.
I will always guess them first and then look at your
next number to see if I was right. By pure luck,
I ought to be right ten times. But I hope to do better
than that *****

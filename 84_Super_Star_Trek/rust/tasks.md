- [ ] conditions and danger messages
- [ ] remove energy on move
- [ ] shields
- [ ] stranded...
- [ ] stop before hitting an object
    - when moving across a sector, the enterprise should stop before it runs into something
    - the current move is a jump, which makes this problematic. would need to rewrite it

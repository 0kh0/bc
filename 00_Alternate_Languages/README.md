#### Alternate Languages

This folder contains implementations of each program in alternate languages which are _not_ one of the agreed upon 10 languages.

Implementations here are NOT bound to these three criteria:

1. Popular (by TIOBE index)
2. Memory safe
3. Generally considered a 'scripting' language

So for example, (here only) C or PASCAL are allowed, but please remain faithful to original look-and-feel (console applications
guidelines, and try to keep the code portable (unless it is not possible, and then be very explicit about it).

We welcome additional ports in whatever language you prefer, but these additional ports are for educational purposes only, and do not count towards the donation total at the end of the project.

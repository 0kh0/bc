# Tasks

Started after movement and display of stats was finished (no energy management or collision detection or anything).

- [x] klingon movement
- [x] klingon firing, game over etc
- [ ] remove energy on move
- [ ] shields
- [ ] stranded...
- [ ] stop before hitting an object
    - when moving across a sector, the enterprise should stop before it runs into something
    - the current move is a jump, which makes this problematic. would need to rewrite it
